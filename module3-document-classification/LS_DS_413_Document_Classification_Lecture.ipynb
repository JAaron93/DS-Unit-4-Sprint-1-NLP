That means you're ready to combine and practice those skills in a kaggle competition. We we will open with a five minute sprint explaining the competition, and then give you 25 minutes to work. After those twenty five minutes are up, I will give a 5-minute demo an NLP technique that will help you with document classification (*and **maybe** the competition*).\n",

    "Sklearn pipelines allow you to stitch together multiple components of a machine learning process. The idea is that you can pass you raw data and get predictions out of the pipeline. This ability to pass raw input and receive a prediction from a singular class makes pipelines well suited for production, because you can pickle a a pipeline without worry about other data preprocessing steps. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Note:* Each time we call the pipeline during grid search, each component is fit again. The vectorizer (tf-idf) is transforming our entire vocabulary during each cross-validation fold. That transformation adds significant run time to our grid search. There *might* be interactions between the vectorizer and our classifier, so we estimate their performance together in the code below. However, if your goal is to reduce run time. Train your vectorizer separately (ie out of the grid-searched pipeline). "
