That means you're ready to combine and practice those skills in a kaggle competition. We we will open with a five minute sprint explaining the competition, and then give you 25 minutes to work. After those twenty five minutes are up, I will give a 5-minute demo an NLP technique that will help you with document classification (*and **maybe** the competition*).\n",

       "0     \\nSometimes, when whisky is batched, a few leftover barrels are returned to the warehouse. Canadian Club recently pulled and vatted several of these from the 1970s. Acetone, Granny Smith apples, and fresh-cut white cedar showcase this long age. Complex and spicy, yet reserved, this dram is ripe with strawberries, canned pears, cloves, pepper, and faint flowers, then slightly pulling oak tannins. Distinct, elegant, and remarkably vibrant, this ancient Canadian Club is anything but tired. (Australia only) A$133  \n",
       "1                                               \\nAn uncommon exclusive bottling of a 6 year old cask strength malt. Light gold in color, the nose is vegetal, more peat bog than peat smoke, with an undercurrent of pastry cream and rose. It’s an odd combination of aromas. The entry is flavorful and inviting with smoked pineapple, clove, and rose. Peak smoke arrives in full force in the mid-palate, which drops the sweet and becomes spicy. The finish is mostly smoke, but with a pleasant minty coolness.  (Wyoming only)  \n",
       "2                                    \\nThis release is a port version of Amrut’s Intermediate Sherry — a sort of port pipe sandwich. The spirit is matured in both unused casks and bourbon casks, then spends a few months in port pipes, and then returns to bourbon casks. The result is a Pink Floyd show of a whisky: vibrant, colorful, complex, and nearly too much. A blackcurrant and wispy, smoky nose gives way to an intense and bittersweet mix of chili, blackcurrant, oak, damson, dark chocolate, and peat. Astounding.   \n",

The nose offers peeled red apples, sultanas, honey, fudge, milk chocolate, and American cream soda. Balanced and harmonious throughout, the palate yields remarkably fresh orchard fruits, pipe tobacco, black pepper, and ginger. Long in the finish, with cinnamon drying to dark chocolate, and slightly smoky, unobtrusively tannic oak. A 1970s classic!  \n",

The palate is slightly grain-forward, but is full and well balanced, with orange, dried flowers, chamomile tea, lemon rind, and ginger. The finish offers cinnamon and milk chocolate against a note of candied lemon. Youthful and barrel-influenced, but admirably executed.  \n",

       "4082              \\nWhat lies beneath the surface of Dewar’s? Here, the blend is finished in virgin and first-fill bourbon casks especially charred, then scratched to enable deeper penetration. Thick wedge of vanilla and fudge with oaky accents, a dusty mouthfeel pulling in vanilla, light lemon, milk chocolate, and sweet toffee, ending on a cocoa powder note. Compared with regular White Label, this is less obviously sweet and creamy, adds complexity, and opens a bourbon connection. Certainly, this is up to scratch.  \n",

The nose offers resinous wine notes, melon, grapefruit, and a hint of vanilla. Nutty on the palate, with orchard fruits, more vanilla, and milk chocolate. Peaches and a slightly oily note in the finish, with apples, nutmeg, and a sprinkling of black pepper.  \n",

While not a showstopper, it delivers generous sweet fruit, almost candied red apple sweetness, along with floral and black cherry notes. On the palate, it shows modest structure, with notes of lemon and pistachio, along with gentle wisps of baking spice and sandalwood. A blend of two Kentucky straight rye whiskeys and two Kentucky straight bourbons.  \n",
       "4085                                     \\nI’m calling this the pitmaster’s dram: the nose has muscular peat smoke, prune juice, savory notes of barbecued brisket bark, venison charcuterie, and a hint of peppermint cream. The palate is a gluttonous feast of sweet dark fruits, milk chocolate, dried fig, plum, sultanas, and ginger, sliding into baked orange and spicy gingerbread, and wallowing luxuriously in chocolate and rich fruit. A welcome addition to Eifel’s already impressive range. (1,200 bottles for the U.S.)  \n",
