    "After a week of Natural Language Processing, you've learned some cool new stuff: how to process text, how turn text into vectors, and how to model topics from documents. Apply your newly acquired skills to one of the most famous NLP datasets out there: [Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/dataset). As part of the job selection process, some of my friends have been asked to create analysis of this dataset, so I want to empower you to have a head start.  \n",

    "The real dataset is massive (almost 8 gigs uncompressed). I've sampled the data for you to something more manageable for the Sprint Challenge. You can analyze the full dataset as a stretch goal or after the sprint challenge. As you work on the challenge, I suggest adding notes about your findings and things you want to analyze in the future.\n",

       "2     I've been to Vegas dozens of times and had never stepped foot into Circus Circus.  For one reason mostly, the resort is marketed to familes that travel to Vegas, so what business does a twenty-three year old have at Circus Circus? Well, I needed a room for one night and I got on hotels.com and the rate was only $24 so I pulled the trigger.  Upon arriving, the interior was nicer than I expected and check-in went by fast even with a long line.\\n\\nThe young lady checked me in and explained how to get to my room, which looked like quite a journey. I eventually made it to my room and bypassed the kids area, restaurants, and bars. I entered my key card and was surprised at how nice a room $25 could buy.

It was restaurant week, so they offered a limited menu, we all head the quinoa meatballs, which took some getting use to, but we ended up enjoying them. They brought a house salad course next that I felt was unnecessary. The white balsamic vin was really good. The final course was an option of stuffed pumpkin ravioli with honey crisp apple cream sauce or the daily risotto. Both options were really good the sauce on the ravioli was smooth and buttery and the risotto was filled with bacon Italian cheeses, red peppers, and bleu cheese . Great choices !

FAKE, FAKE, FAKE....We also own a small business in Los Alamitos, CA and received what looked like a legitimate bill for $70 with an account number and all.  I called the phone number listed (866) 273-7934.  The wait time on hold said 20 minutes and to leave a message.  I could not get a live person on the phone no matter what number I selected.  I left a very FIRM message that I would be contacting the BBB and my attorney regarding their company trying to scam businesses. This has to be illegal!!!!!   \n",

       "2     I've been to Vegas dozens of times and had never stepped foot into Circus Circus.  For one reason mostly, the resort is marketed to familes that travel to Vegas, so what business does a twenty-three year old have at Circus Circus? Well, I needed a room for one night and I got on hotels.com and the rate was only $24 so I pulled the trigger.  Upon arriving, the interior was nicer than I expected and check-in went by fast even with a long line.\\n\\nThe young lady checked me in and explained how to get to my room, which looked like quite a journey. I eventually made it to my room and bypassed the kids area, restaurants, and bars. I entered my key card and was surprised at how nice a room $25 could buy.

We waited and 45 minutes passed and the guy was nowhere to be found. Turns out he was sitting at the tables in the food court, on his phone. If you have to close the register from the night before and it's 3:15am, why didn't you do that at 12:00am? Like, did this guy decide to take a break while he was \"restarting\" the register.\\n\\nKinda disappointed but we won't let that ruin our weekend in Las Vegas.   \n",
       "9996  My wife and I came here with a a couple of friends. The sever was very excited, almost to the point of being obnoxious, but she was helpful. It was restaurant week, so they offered a limited menu, we all head the quinoa meatballs, which took some getting use to, but we ended up enjoying them. They brought a house salad course next that I felt was unnecessary. The white balsamic vin was really good. The final course was an option of stuffed pumpkin ravioli with honey crisp apple cream sauce or the daily risotto. Both options were really good the sauce on the ravioli was smooth and buttery and the risotto was filled with bacon Italian cheeses, red peppers, and bleu cheese . Great choices !

First, I have been here several times and each time it just horrific but I usually get comps so I go back for free, I had to pay for this one night and of course the ridiculous \"resort fees\".  NO MORE.  I will pay for a Hilton Vacation before this again.  This last time, there was NO hot water for an entire day.  How can you wash this nastiness off of you with no hot water?  I was always being told it will be on in 15 mins.  Never was.  So upon checkout I refused to pay for the room.  I was charged anyways.

       "2     I've been to Vegas dozens of times and had never stepped foot into Circus Circus.  For one reason mostly, the resort is marketed to familes that travel to Vegas, so what business does a twenty-three year old have at Circus Circus? Well, I needed a room for one night and I got on hotels.com and the rate was only $24 so I pulled the trigger.  Upon arriving, the interior was nicer than I expected and check-in went by fast even with a long line.\\n\\nThe young lady checked me in and explained how to get to my room, which looked like quite a journey. I eventually made it to my room and bypassed the kids area, restaurants, and bars. I entered my key card and was surprised at how nice a room $25 could buy.

If you have to close the register from the night before and it's 3:15am, why didn't you do that at 12:00am?

       "9996  My wife and I came here with a a couple of friends. The sever was very excited, almost to the point of being obnoxious, but she was helpful. It was restaurant week, so they offered a limited menu, we all head the quinoa meatballs, which took some getting use to, but we ended up enjoying them. They brought a house salad course next that I felt was unnecessary. The white balsamic vin was really good. The final course was an option of stuffed pumpkin ravioli with honey crisp apple cream sauce or the daily risotto. Both options were really good the sauce on the ravioli was smooth and buttery and the risotto was filled with bacon Italian cheeses, red peppers, and bleu cheese . Great choices !

The area in which I live has a limited selection of quality affordable vehicles. I exhausted my efforts purchasing vehicles locally. I was forced to search for vehicles outside of Humboldt county. Many fruitless searches finally led me to Go Best Auto sales in southern California. The vehicles looked to be in good shape according to the online photos and the prices were reasonable. Car prices were also in line with Kelly blue book, as well as other online resources (car gurus, Edmunds, etc.). I was skeptical due to many years of owning my delivery business and purchasing dozens of delivery vehicles over the past 17 years. I researched and compared similar vehicles in multiple cities and dealerships. It became very clear in a short amount of time that Shawn had the best selection, price, and professionalism available to my business. We spoke over the phone and he answered all of my questions, (which I had many), honestly and adeptly. I wasn't sure if I could afford all of the vehicles outright and he provided me with contact info for Jamie (@Cambridge capital), their in house financing. They too were patient and forthright with my needs. I explained to Shawn the need to expedite the vehicle sales (due to my rapid expansion), as well as the necessity of transport to my area in northern California. He worked with me to keep costs low as well as having my vans shipped to me in a very short period of time after the purchase of vehicles. Shawn was especially honest about the timeframe in which he could reasonably ship the vans to my business in Humboldt. He didn't want to promise something that he couldn't deliver on. It turns out that he found a reputable truck transporter in record time and had my vans delivered to me the next day (which just so happened to be a couple of days before I absolutely needed them). The Van's I bought were low miles, fleet maintained, government owned, and lacking in defects. The 2005 E350 Ford arrived with brand new tires and the 2006 Chevy Express 2500 had various aftermarket extras. Both vehicles were immaculately detailed and in perfect working order. So far so good mechanically, and I have been using them excessively during the holiday peak season rush. I will more than likely be expanding in the future and Shawn at Best Auto sales will be the person I call to purchase vehicles from. I can't say enough to Shawn's honesty, caring, attention to detail, efficiency, professionalism and dedication to providing me with quality vehicles. Thanks for being top notch and helping me with my business needs! I while heartedly reccomend Best Auto Sales for your commercial auto needs.\"]"

       "9996   My wife and I came here with a a couple of friends. The sever was very excited, almost to the point of being obnoxious, but she was helpful. It was restaurant week, so they offered a limited menu, we all head the quinoa meatballs, which took some getting use to, but we ended up enjoying them. They brought a house salad course next that I felt was unnecessary. The white balsamic vin was really good. The final course was an option of stuffed pumpkin ravioli with honey crisp apple cream sauce or the daily risotto. Both options were really good the sauce on the ravioli was smooth and buttery and the risotto was filled with bacon Italian cheeses, red peppers, and bleu cheese . Great choices ! We all decided to get to dessert, we could of ski...\n",

       "9999   This is the absolute worst place I have ever stayed in my 43 year life.  First, I have been here several times and each time it just horrific but I usually get comps so I go back for free, I had to pay for this one night and of course the ridiculous \"resort fees\".  NO MORE.  I will pay for a Hilton Vacation before this again.  This last time, there was NO hot water for an entire day.  How can you wash this nastiness off of you with no hot water?  I was always being told it will be on in 15 mins.  Never was.  So upon checkout I refused to pay for the room.  I was charged anyways.  When I got home, I called my credit card company and disputed the charge.  This was April 1, 2016.  On April 27th, my card company reversed the charges and I w...\n",
       "10000  Recently I doubled my workforce and was in need of solid, well priced vehicles in a short amount of time. The area in which I live has a limited selection of quality affordable vehicles. I exhausted my efforts purchasing vehicles locally. I was forced to search for vehicles outside of Humboldt county. Many fruitless searches finally led me to Go Best Auto sales in southern California. The vehicles looked to be in good shape according to the online photos and the prices were reasonable. Car prices were also in line with Kelly blue book, as well as other online resources (car gurus, Edmunds, etc.).

I purchased my last one from them quite a few years ago. It lasted me until my daughter totaled it... This one is a lot nicer, but then again it is a newer vehicle. The quality of vehicles and level of service and customer care is the same or better than it was before. You can't really improve upon very close to perfection. I would strongly recommend that anyone looking for a fairly priced high quality used vehicle contact John Zambroski at Centennial. I was able to get the extended warranty as well as gap insurance for the monthly payment I was hoping for without either. Really can't beat that. Thank you John!\n",
